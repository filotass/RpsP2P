# RpsP2P
A peer to peer implementation of the Rock Paper Scissors Game. Fully Decentralized.<br>

It is assumed that there is an unstructured overlay of peers without any cyclical connections. <br>
That assumption simplifies things since there is only one path from one peer to another through other multiple peers.<br>
(Think Lord of the Rings where the signal to help is being propagated by lighing fires across the mountains)<br>
This implementation uses a Gnutella-like style as a peer discovery mechanism.<br>
<br>
Each peer has 3 distinct roles to perform:<br>
Client<br>
Server<br>
Router
